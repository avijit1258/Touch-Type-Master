	Fourth Story:
	The Prince and Princess

	"Gerda was obliged to rest again, and just opposite the place where she sat, she saw a great crow come hopping across the snow toward her. He stood looking at her for some time, and then he wagged his head and said, "Caw, caw; good-day, good-day." He pronounced the words as plainly as he could, because he meant to be kind to the little girl; and then he asked her where she was going all alone in the wide world.

	The word alone Gerda understood very well, and knew how much it expressed. So then she told the crow the whole story of her life and adventures, and asked him if he had seen little Kay.

	The crow nodded his head very gravely, and said, "Perhaps I have-it may be."

	"No! Do you think you have?" cried little Gerda, and she kissed the crow, and hugged him almost to death with joy.

	"Gently, gently," said the crow. "I believe I know. I think it may be little Kay; but he has certainly forgotten you by this time for the princess."

	"Does he live with a princess?" asked Gerda.

	"Yes, listen," replied the crow, "but it is so difficult to speak your language. If you understand the crows' language1 then I can explain it better. Do you?"

	"No, I have never learnt it," said Gerda, "but my grandmother understands it, and used to speak it to me. I wish I had learnt it."
